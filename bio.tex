\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Autobiographical Statement}
I am a Ph.D. student in Wayne State University's Department of Computer Science with a focus in real-time systems and a minor in Mechanical Engineering. I help advance real-time, safety-critical systems through research; provide education in computer science ethics through university teaching; and facilitate robotics education through volunteering at local high schools and robotics competitions.
